# Machine Learning Overview and Code Files

This repository contains resources and code to explore fundamental concepts in Machine Learning (ML), particularly supervised learning and linear regression, using Python. 

## Machine Learning Concepts

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions. Key concepts covered include:

- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models (e.g., classification and regression tasks).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Teaches an agent to take actions based on rewards or penalties.

## File Descriptions

- **ML.txt**: Notes on ML concepts, including learning types and model evaluation.
- **README.md**: Overview of repository contents.
- **Studentmodule.pickle**: Serialized data or model related to student performance.
- **linear_reg.py**: Python script for a simple linear regression model.
- **magic.py**: Script to experiment with the "magic" dataset for classification.
- **magic04.data** and **magic04.names**: Dataset files for binary classification tasks.
- **student_mat.csv**: Dataset for exploring supervised learning, focusing on student performance.
