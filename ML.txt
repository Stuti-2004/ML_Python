What is machine learning?

Ai is an area of CS where the goal is to simulate Human behaviour
ML is a subet of AI that tries to solve a specific problem and makr precitions

TYPES:
*1. Supervised learning: labelled inputs (input has a direct output) to train models and learn outputs
*2. Unsupervised learning: unlabelled inputs to learn about patterns in data
3. Reinforcement learning: an agent learning using rewards or penalties

SUPERVISED LEARNING:
- Feature vector consists of various inputs 
    - qualitative = nominal data (no order) -> using one-hot encoding (assgins 1 to correct value)
        eg. USA = [0,0,1] or ordinal (there is a order)
    - quantitative = numerical can be continous or discrete

Classification:
- predict discrete class (binary classification or multiclass classification)

Regression:
- predict continous values (print a value based on a scale)

Model:
- break into 3 data sets - training, validation and testing
- loss = differences between prediction and labels
    L1loss = |yreal - ypredicted|
    L2loss = (yreal - ypredicted)^2
    etc.
